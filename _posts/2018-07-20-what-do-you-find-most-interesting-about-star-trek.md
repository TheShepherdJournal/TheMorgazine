<p>When I was a kid, “Star Trek” was one of the few science fiction shows on TV, and I watched it all of the time thanks to the power of UHF channels and TV syndication. Back then, there weren’t a lot of choices. Star Trek’s only other competitor was “Lost in Space,” another series which was in syndication around the same time. I found the robot in LIS to be interesting, but it always seemed like they were stuck on the same planet.</p>
<p>Back then, as ten-year-old I appreciated “Star Trek” for its eye candy, i.e. the special effects. I loved seeing them fire their phasers, or when another ship was shown on the screen. “Botany Bay,” and “Doomsday Machine” were always my favorite episodes, because of the fight scenes. As I grew older, I started to appreciate the show for its storylines and its message.</p>
<p>Overall, I’ve always liked the optimistic view of the future that was depicted in Star Trek. So many other series liked to predict doom and gloom, or destruction if aliens were involved. Gene Roddenberry brought us a vision of the future in which mankind strives for better things. Greed, hunger, and war are a thing of the past (for Earth, at least).</p>
<p>Star Trek is really an anthology series. The main characters stay the same, but travel to different planets or parts of space where they encounter a new kind of problem or discovery. This allowed the series to tell stories which focussed on a lot of different topics. It was safe to do in science fiction, because you could use an analogy to make the message a little more palatable. For example, racism.</p>
<p>I was always fascinated most of all by Mr. Spock. I always wanted to be like him, until I realized years later that the real point behind his character might have been that it is not so desirable to be without emotion. For the longest time, I didn’t really understand that the character wore prosthetic ears...I thought Leonard Nimoy’s ears really were shaped that way, and this is why he was cast for the part.</p>
<p>I think that “Star Trek” is a once-in-a-lifetime phenomenon. It is a product of its time, and while there have been plenty of other shows which strived to capture the same magic (“SeaQuest DSV,” “The Orville,” and to a degree “Stargate SG-1”) they never will.</p>
<p>Spin-offs of the original series have also struggled to capture the same magic. “The Next Generation” came the closest, but of course with a different cast and technology it couldn’t be the same. “Deep Space Nine” was an excellent offering, but was the show which broke the mold by skewing the vision of mankind’s perfect future without conflict. By “Voyager,” and “Enterprise,” networks were getting too involved so there wasn’t a chance of recapturing the magic of the original (which is ironic, since Star Trek also was not respected by its network at the time, NBC).</p>
<p>The JJVerse reboots are the best illustration of why there can never be another “Star Trek.” They’ve recast the original actors, and tried to tell Star Trek stories but really don’t get it. Maybe it’s because of pressure from movie studios, or the film media, or all of the above.</p>
